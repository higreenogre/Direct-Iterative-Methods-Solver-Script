# Linear Equation Solver code (MATLAB) for different Direct/Iterative methods

## The codes for the different DIRECT methods are :

1. GAUSS ELIMINATION
2. GAUSS-JORDAN ELIMINATION
3. THE MATRIX INVERSE METHOD
( here I've added a separate function to calculate the inverse )
4. DOOLITTLE LU FACTORIZATION

## The codes for the different ITERATIVE methods are :

1. JACOBIAN ITERATION
2. GAUSS-SEIDAL ITERATION
3. SUCCESSIVE-OVER-RELAXATION

# How to read?

1. An example problem for all the 7 types of solvers are given separately and consecutively with the calling of the respective functions.
2. The functions for all the types can be located below right after the example problems and have all been included in the same SCRIPT FILE.

THANKYOU
